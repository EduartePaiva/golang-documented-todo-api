# Project Golang, overengineered Todo App

This project is a collection os a hude amount of technologies that produces, a simple Todo App, I think it's quite ironic and funny, at the same time. But the objective is not really a todo, but to put in practice, a lot of coding best practices, technologies and techniques together.

This project will be a resource for myself and others developers who stumble on this repository
